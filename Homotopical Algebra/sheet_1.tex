\section*{Exercise 6}
Suppose we have a natural transformation $\tau:F\rightarrow G$. We want to associate to $\tau$ a functor $H_\tau:\cC\times[1]\rightarrow\cD$ in a meaningful way. In fact we want that this association to remind us of the notion of homotopy in regular homotopy theory. \\
We propose the follwing definition. For an object $(c,x)\in \Ob\cC\times[1]$ and an arrow $(f,p)\in \Ob\cC\times[1]((c,x),(c',x'))$ we set their image by $H_\tau$:
	\begin{align*}
		H_\tau(c,x)=
			\begin{cases}
				F(c) &  \mathrm{if}\ x=0,\\
				G(c) & \mathrm{if}\ x=1
			\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
and 
	\begin{align*}
		H_\tau(f,p)=
			\begin{cases}
				F(f)  & \mathrm{if}\ p=0\leq0,\\
				\tau_{c'}F(f)=G(f)\tau_c & \mathrm{if}\ p=0\leq1,\\
				G(f) & \mathrm{if}\ p=1\leq1.
			\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
Note that the equalitiy in the second line is due to the fact that $\tau$ is a natural transformation. First, we need to prove that $H_\tau$ is a functor.\\
Let us consider the identity $\Id_{(c,x)}$. We want to prove that $H_\tau(\Id_{(c,x)})=\Id_{H_\tau(c,x)}$. We distinguish two cases:\\
